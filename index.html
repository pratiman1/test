    <h1>Recycling e-Waste and Li Batteries</h1>
	<p>Electronic waste, or e-waste, is a growing problem around the world. When electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, and televisions are thrown away, they can release harmful chemicals into the environment. Similarly, lithium batteries, which are commonly used in electronics, can also be dangerous if not recycled properly.</p>
	<p>Recycling e-waste and Li batteries is an important way to protect the environment and reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. By recycling these materials, we can recover valuable resources and reduce our carbon footprint.</p>
